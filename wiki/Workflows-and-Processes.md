## Task Lifecycle Overview

Tasks move through a structured lifecycle with specific approval gates:

## Workflow 1: Backlog to Pending

**Purpose**: Ensure client approval before starting development work.

### Initial State

- **Status**: `Backlog`
- **Ready for Client Review**: `false` (unchecked)
- **Client Approved for Development**: `false` (unchecked)

### Step 1: PM Submits for Client Review

**Who**: Project Manager

**Action**:
1. Open the task record
2. Check the **Ready for Client Review** checkbox
3. Click **Save**

**What Happens**:
- Status remains `Backlog`
- Approval process is automatically triggered: `Approval_Process_Project_Task_Waiting_For_Client_Approval_on_Backlog_Task`
- Client receives approval request notification

**Validation**:
- `Ready for Client Review` can only be `true` when Status = `Backlog`
- If validation fails, an error message is displayed

### Step 2a: Client Approves

**Who**: Client User

**Action**:
1. Client receives approval request (email/notification)
2. Client reviews the task
3. Client approves the request

**What Happens Automatically**:
- `Client Approved for Development` is set to `true`
- Status automatically changes to `Pending`
- Task is now ready to begin development
- Developer can start work

**Result**:
- Task moves to development queue
- Developer can change status to "In Progress" when starting work

### Step 2b: Client Rejects

**Who**: Client User

**Action**:
1. Client receives approval request
2. Client reviews the task
3. Client rejects the request (with optional comments)

**What Happens Automatically**:
- `Client Approved for Development` remains `false`
- Status remains `Backlog`
- `Ready for Client Review` may remain `true` (PM can address feedback)

**Result**:
- PM receives rejection notification
- PM can address feedback, update task, and resubmit
- Task remains in Backlog until approved

### Resubmission Process

If a task is rejected:
1. PM addresses client feedback
2. Updates task description or other fields as needed
3. `Ready for Client Review` is already checked (or PM checks it again)
4. Approval process is triggered again
5. Client reviews and approves/rejects

## Workflow 2: In Review to Completed

**Purpose**: Ensure quality through internal review and client sign-off before marking complete.

### Initial State

- **Status**: `In Review`
- **Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer**: `false` (unchecked)
- **Client Approved for Completion**: `false` (unchecked)

### Step 1: Task Moves to In Review

**Who**: Developer

**Action**:
1. Developer completes work on the task
2. Changes status from `In Progress` to `In Review`
3. Clicks **Save**

**What Happens**:
- Status is now `In Review`
- Approval process is automatically triggered: `Approval_Process_Project_Task_PM_Code_Reviewer_Approval`
- PM/Code Reviewer receives approval request notification

### Step 2: PM/Code Reviewer Approval

**Who**: PM or Code Reviewer

**Action**:
1. PM/Code Reviewer receives approval request
2. Reviews the completed work
3. Approves or rejects

**If Approved**:
- `Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer` is automatically set to `true`
- Status remains `In Review`
- Client approval process is automatically triggered: `Approval_Process_Project_Task_Client_Completion_Approval`
- Client receives approval request

**If Rejected**:
- `Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer` remains `false`
- Status may change back to `In Progress` (depending on workflow configuration)
- Developer receives rejection notification with feedback
- Developer addresses feedback and resubmits

### Step 3: Client Completion Approval

**Who**: Client User

**Prerequisites**:
- `Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer` = `true`
- Status = `In Review`
- `Client Approved for Completion` = `false`

**Action**:
1. Client receives approval request
2. Client reviews the completed work
3. Client approves or rejects

**If Approved**:
- `Client Approved for Completion` is automatically set to `true`
- Status automatically changes to `Completed`
- Task is ready for deployment

**If Rejected**:
- `Client Approved for Completion` remains `false`
- Status may change back to `In Progress` (depending on workflow configuration)
- Developer receives rejection notification
- Developer addresses feedback and resubmits

### Quick Actions

For faster workflow, use Quick Actions:

#### Mark Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer
- Available on tasks with Status = `In Review`
- Quickly sets `Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer` = `true`
- Triggers client approval process

#### Mark Reviewed by Client
- Available on tasks with Status = `In Review` and `Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer` = `true`
- Quickly sets `Client Approved for Completion` = `true`
- Changes status to `Completed`

## Status Transitions

### Valid Status Transitions

| From Status | To Status | Requirements |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Backlog | Pending | `Client Approved for Development` = `true` |
| Backlog | Removed | No approval needed (cancellation) |
| Pending | In Progress | No approval needed |
| Pending | Backlog | No approval needed (reprioritization) |
| Pending | Removed | No approval needed (cancellation) |
| In Progress | In Review | No approval needed |
| In Progress | Backlog | No approval needed (reprioritization) |
| In Progress | Removed | No approval needed (cancellation) |
| In Review | Completed | `Reviewed by PM/Code Reviewer` = `true` AND `Client Approved for Completion` = `true` |
| In Review | In Progress | Rejection or feedback needed |
| Completed | Closed | No approval needed (final closure) |
| Any | Removed | No approval needed (cancellation) |

### Status Field Values
